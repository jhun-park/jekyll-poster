This program is faciliating easier and more comfortable to make and post an article for users who are having diffculty or feeling uncomfortable to use or post articles.

Whenever you do try to write a post, you would be feeling uncomfortable to adhere writing frontmatter and etc.

And then, it has more difficulties in writing, e.g. whenever you try to write an artice,

you must access your local directory's folder and then open and write an article and then you have to do 'add', 'commit', 'push'.

I did search of programs like these difficulties for resolving, but i couldn't find sufficient stuffs to resolve these difficulties.

I started making this program on January 31st, so it is currently in the developing stage, so it may has a few areas of deficiency.

If you are jekyll blogger, contribute this repository and then completely complete this program.

This program is designed to facilitate a more comfortable and efficient experience for users like me who find it challenging to write and publish articles .

Often, the process can be cumbersome, involving strict adherence to writing frontmatter, navigating local directories, and executing multiple commands like 'add', 'commit', and 'push' for uploading github pages' blog. 

Recognizing the lack of sufficient tools to streamline these tasks, i tried to develop this program on January 31st. 

It's currently in the developmental stage and may have areas that need improvement.

I invite Jekyll bloggers to contribute to this repository and help us enhance this program to its full potential."
